# Code Review
Code review written by Sofia Dersén.

1. index.html:30 - The spinning sloths are quite close to the edges on smaller screens. Perhaps some margins would fix that.
2. index.html:34 - There is a div that, from what I can see isn’t used. Maybe it could be removed?
3. functions.js:1-14 - The sloths-array is missing alt-texts. You could make it a multidimensional array and add alt texts to each gif instead of having the same for all.
4. functions.js:30 - The name; buttonEat is not descriptive, perhaps slothBtn would be a better name?
5. spinningSloths.js:24-32 - What a nice fun feature with the spinning Sloths! You could have assigned an event listener inside the first forEach where you created your images. (Pssst… you have a variable called “hejsan” left…).
